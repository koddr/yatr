**Y**et **A**nother **T**ask **R**unner (or `yatr` for a short) allows 
you to organize and automate your routine operations that you normally do in 
`Makefile` (or else) for each project. Supports **all** popular formats (JSON, 
YAML, TOML, HCL) of the task file and has a **beautiful** appearance.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

First, [download][go_download] and install **Go**. Version `1.20` (or higher)
is required.

Installation is done by using the [`go install`][go_install] command:

```console
go install github.com/koddr/yatr@latest
```

Prepare your task file in one of the supported formats:

- `json` ‚Äì JSON ([example][json_example_file])
- `yaml` / `yml` ‚Äì YAML ([example][yaml_example_file])
- `toml` ‚Äì TOML ([example][toml_example_file])
- `tf` ‚Äì Terraform, HCL ([example][tf_example_file])

> üí° Note: See the repository's [Wiki page][wiki_url] to understand
> structures of task file and get general recommendations.

Next, run `yatr` with (_or without_) options:

```console
yatr -p ./path/to/tasks-file.json
```

Done! üéâ Your tasks have been executed.

## üß© Options

- `-p [path]` set a **path** to the file with tasks in any of the supporting 
  format (see [Wiki][wiki_tasks_file_url]);
